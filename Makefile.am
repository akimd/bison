# See comments in build-aux/git-version-gen.  However, we make .version depend
# on configure so that .version and VERSION/PACKAGE_VERSION stay in sync in the
# working copy (for example, when you run autoreconf && make).  Allowing these
# to fall out of sync appears to have little potential to improve Bison build
# efficiency (even if we were to replace VERSION/PACKAGE_VERSION with .version
# everywhere possible).  On the other hand, it could be harmful.  For example,
# a developer might naively reference .version in a test case while the bison
# executable still compiles with VERSION, and so the test case might fail or
# pass incorrectly.
