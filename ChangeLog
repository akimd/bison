	header have the same name.

2002-03-04  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* src/reader.c (readgram): A missing `;' is a warning, not an
	error!

2002-03-04  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* tests/sets.at (Broken Closure): Add the ending `;'.
	* tests/input.at (Invalid $n, Invalid @n): Likewise.
	* tests/output.at (AT_CHECK_OUTPUT): Likewise.

	* src/getargs.c [AS_FILE_NAME] [__DJGPP__]: New macro STRLWR.
	Check that no NULL pointer is passed to strlwr.

2002-02-14  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Remove the support for C++ namespace cleanliness; it was
	causing more problems than it was curing, since it didn't work
	properly on some nonstandard C++ compilers.  This can wait
	for a proper C++ parser.

	* NEWS: Document this.
	* doc/bison.texinfo (Bison Parser, Debugging): Remove special mention
	of C++, as it's treated like C now.
	* src/bison.simple (YYSTD): Remove.
	(YYSIZE_T, YYFPRINTF, YYPARSE_PARAM_ARG, YYPARSE_PARAM_DECL):
	Treat C++ just like Standard C instead of trying to support
	namespace cleanliness.

2002-02-14  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* tests/regression.at (else): Adjust to Andreas' change.

2002-02-13  Andreas Schwab  <schwab@suse.de>

	* src/output.c (output_rule_data): Don't output NULL, it might
	not be defined yet.

2002-02-13  Guerrero, Juan Manuel  <st001906@hrz1.hrz.tu-darmstadt.de>

	* doc/bison.texinfo:  Add DJGPP specific information about
	file name extensions used on different file systems.

	* src/files.c (output_files): MSDOS conditional removed.
	New macro EXT_TYPE will provide at runtime the appropiate
	output file extension.
	(skeleton_find) [MSDOS]: __DJGPP__ conditional added to
	inhibit the use of DOSish code.  POSIX like behaviour.

	* src/getargs.c [AS_FILE_NAME]: __DJGPP__ conditional added.
	Check at runtime if LFN-API (case preserving) is available or not.
	Do not unconditionly convert upper case strings in lower case strings.

	* src/system.h [MSDOS] [__GO32__]: __DJGPP__ conditional added.
	__GO32__ is obsolete and its use is deprecated.
	[MSDOS]: __DJGPP__ conditional added.  Use pathconf
	to choose POSIX or DOS file extensions at run time.
	[MSDOS] [__DJGPP__]: New macro EXT_TYPE.  If LFN-API is
	available, the src or header file extension (.c or .h) will be
	added to the output file name. If no LFN-API is available no src
	or header file extension will be added to the output file name.
	[MSDOS] [!__DJGPP__]: New macro EXT_TYPE. Src file and header
        file extension will never be added to the output file name.
	[!MSDOS]: New macro EXT_TYPE. Src file and header file
	extensions will always be added to the output file name.

2002-02-11  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* tests/regression.at (%nonassoc and eof): Don't include non
	portable headers.

	* src/reader.c (copy_at): Detect invalid @N values.

2002-02-07  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* tests/input.at: New.

2002-01-29  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/bison.simple (YYSIZE_T): Do not define merely because
	YYSTACK_USE_ALLOCA is nonzero or alloca or _ALLOCA_H are defined.
	On some platforms, <alloca.h> does not declare YYSTD (size_t).

2002-01-25  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* tests/regression.at (%nonassoc and eof): New.
	Suggested by Robert Anisko.

2002-01-23  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	Version 1.32.

2002-01-23  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* src/getargs.c (version): Bump to 2002.
	Patch the PO files to help translators.

2002-01-20  Marc Autret  <marc@gnu.org>

	* src/system.h: Need to	define __attribute__ away for non-GCC
	compilers as well (i.e.	the vendor C compiler).
	Suggested by Albert Chin-A-Young.

2002-01-19  Marc Autret  <marc@gnu.org>

	* tests/output.at: New test.
	* src/files.c (compute_base_names): Don't map extensions when

	* tests/regression.at (Invalid CPP headers): Remove.

2002-01-12  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	Version 1.30l.

2002-01-12  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* lib/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add strnlen.c: Automake is still
	not using Autoconf traces and does not see Autoconf's AC_LIBOBJ.

2002-01-11  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	Version 1.30k.

2002-01-11  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	Fixes the failures observed on AIX 4.3 by H.Merijn Brand.

2002-01-09  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	Version 1.30j.

2002-01-09  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* configure.in (WERROR_CFLAGS): Compute it.
	* src/Makefile.am (CFLAGS): Pass it.
	* tests/atlocal.in (CFLAGS): Idem.

2002-01-08  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* src/getargs.c (AS_FILE_NAME): New.
	(getargs): Use it to convert DOSish file names.
	* src/files.c (base_name): Rename as full_base_name to avoid
	clashes with `base_name ()'.
	(get_extension_index): Remove.
	(filename_split): New.
	(compute_base_names): N-th rewrite, using filename_split.

2002-01-08  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* lib/basename.c, lib/dirname.h, lib/dirname.c, lib/memrchr.c,
	* lib/xstrndup.c, lib/strchr.c:
	New, stolen from the Fileutils 4.1.
	* lib/Makefile.am (libbison_a_SOURCES): Adjust.
	* configure.in: Check for the presence of memrchr, strchr,
	strnlen, and of their prototypes.
	Don't check for strndup: we no longer use it.
	* src/system.h: Adjust the prototypes.

2002-01-07  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* src/conflicts.c (count_rr_conflicts): The previous RR conflicts
	patch was improperly applied: fix it.

2002-01-07  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* tests/torture.at (GNU Cim Grammar): Reintroduce their weird
	'switch' without a following semicolon.
	* tests/regression.at (braces parsing): New.

2002-01-06  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	Bison is dead wrong in its RR conflict reports.

	* tests/torture.at (GNU Cim Grammar): New.
	* src/conflicts.c (count_rr_conflicts): Fix.

2002-01-06  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	Creating package.m4 from configure.ac causes too many problems.

	* tests/Makefile.am (package.m4): Create it by hand,
	AC_CONFIG_TESTDIR no longer does in the most recent CVS Autoconf.

2002-01-04  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* doc/bison.texinfo (Debugging):
	Remove YYSTDERR; it's no longer defined or used.
	Also, s/cstdio.h/cstdio/.

2002-01-03  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* src/files.h: Add it prototype.

2002-01-03  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* src/files.c, src/files.h (strsuffix): Not static.
	* src/conflicts.c (conflicts_print): Don't consider it is an error

	* tests/bison.in: Adjust to CVS Autoconf.
	* tests/calc.at (exp): We no longer need to special case GCC as

	* tests/atlocal.in: Adjust.
	* configure.in: Bump to 1.30j.

2002-01-03  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	Version 1.30i.

2002-01-03  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* src/bison.simple (YYSTDERR): Remove, replace `stderr'.
	The ISO C++ standard is extremely clear about it: stderr is
	considered a macro, not a regular symbol (see table 94 `Header
	<cstdio> synopsis', [lib.c.files] 27.8.2 C Library files).
	Therefore std:: does not apply to it.  It still does with fprintf.
	Also, s/cstdio.h/cstdio/.

2002-01-03  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* lib/quotearg.c: Use `#include "..."' instead of `#include <...>'
	for non system headers.

2001-12-27  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/bison.simple (YYSTACK_ALLOC, YYSIZE_T): Remove special
	cases for non-GNU systems like AIX, HP-UX, SGI, Sun, and
	Sparc, as they were causing more porting problems than the
	(minor) performance improvement was worth.

2001-12-22  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* src/output.c (output_short_table, output_short_or_char_table):
	Change the prototype to use `int' for array ranges: some
	invocations do pass an int, not a short.
	Reported by Wayne Green.

2001-12-22  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	Some actions of web2c.y are improperly triggered.
	Reported by Mike Castle.

	* src/lalr.c (traverse): s/F (i)[k] = F (j)[k]/F (j)[k] = F (i)[k]/.
	* tests/regression.at (Web2c): Rename as...
	(Web2c Report): this.
	(Web2c Actions): New.

2001-12-22  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* tests/regression.at (Web2c): New.

2001-12-18  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	Version 1.30h.

2001-12-18  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	Some host fail on `assert (!"foo")', which expands to
	((!"foo") ? (void)0 : __assert("!"foo."", __FILE__, __LINE__))
	Reported by Nelson Beebee.

	* src/output.c, src/vcg.c: Replace `assert (!"it succeeded")' with
	`#define it_succeeded 0' and `assert (it_succeeded)'.

2001-12-17  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/bison.simple (YYSTD): New macro.
	(YYSIZE_T, YYSTACK_ALLOC, YYSTACK_FREE, YYFPRINTF, YYSTDERR): Use
	it to simplify macros, and fix some C++ porting problems reported
	by Hans Aberg.

	* src/output.c (output): Define YYDEBUG to 0 if it is not defined
	and if we are not debugging.  POSIX requires this.
	* NEWS, doc/bison.texinfo, doc/bison.1, doc/bison.rnh: Document this.

	* src/output.c (output_gram, output_rule_data): Do not assume that
	the user defines YYDEBUG to a properly parenthesized expression.

2001-12-15  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* src/nullable.c (set_nullable): Useless rules must be skipped,
	otherwise, since we range over their symbols, we might look at a
	nonterminal which no longer ``exists'', i.e., it is not counted in
	`nvars', hence we overflow our arrays.

2001-12-15  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* src/reader.c (copy_action): When --yacc, don't append a `;'
	to the user action: let it fail if lacking.
	Suggested by Arnold Robbins and Tom Tromey.

2001-12-13  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	Version 1.30g.

2001-12-13  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	The computation of nullable is broken: it doesn't handle empty
	RHS's properly.

	* tests/torture.at (GNU AWK Grammar): New.
	* tests/sets.at (Nullable): New.
	* src/nullable.c (set_nullable): Instead of blindly looping over
	`ritems', loop over the rules, and then over their rhs's.

	Work around Autotest bugs.

	* src/warshall.c (bitmatrix_print): Don't use `+--+' as table
	frame, because Autotest understand lines starting with a `+' as
	traces from the shell.  Then, they are not processed properly.
	Admittedly an Autotest bug, but we don't have time to wait for
	Autotest to catch up.
	* tests/regression.at (Broken Closure): Adjust to the new table
	frames.
	Move to...
	* tests/sets.at: here.

2001-12-12  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/bison.simple (YYSIZE_T, YYSTACK_ALLOC, YYSTACK_FREE):
	Do not infringe on the global user namespace when using C++.
	(YYFPRINTF, YYSTDERR): New macros, needed for the above.
	All uses of `fprintf' and `stderr' changed.

	* src/output.c (output): Do not output "#include <stdio.h>"; that
	is bison.simple's job.  stdio.h should be included only if
	necessary, to avoid infringing on the user name space when
	possible.

2001-12-12  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* src/complain.h, src/complain.c: Remove error_one_per_line, rely
	on that of lib/error.c.

2001-12-12  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	Some hosts don't like `/' in includes.

	* src/system.h: Include libgettext.h without qualifying the path.
	* src/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Add $(top_srcdir)/intl, remove
	$(top_srcdir).

2001-12-10  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	Bison dumps core on bash.y.
	Reported by Pascal Bart.

	* src/warshall.c (bitmatrix_print): New.
	(TC): Use it.
	When performing a transitive closure R(i, j) && R(j, k) => R(i,	k),
	j must be the outer loop.
	* tests/regression.at (Broken Closure): New.

2001-12-05  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	Version 1.30f.

2001-12-05  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* tests/atlocal.in (CPPFLAGS): Do not leave a space between -I and
	its argument.
	Reported by Peter Hámorský.

2001-12-05  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* src/conflicts.c (err_table): Remove.
	(resolve_sr_conflict): Adjust.
	* src/lalr.h (state_t.reduction_table, state_t.shift_table):
	Rename as...
	(state_t.reductions, state_t.shifts): this.

2001-12-05  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* src/reduce.c (reduce_grammar_tables): No longer disable the
	removal of useless rules via CPP but via `if (0)', so that the
	compiler still check the code is valid.
	For instance, it should have noticed `rline' no longer exists: use
	the `line' member of rule_t.
	* src/gram.c (dummy, rline): Remove, unused.

2001-12-05  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* src/output.c (pack_vector): Use assert, not berror.
	* src/main.c (berror): Remove, unused.

2001-12-05  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	New experimental feature: if --verbose --trace output all the
	items of a state, not only its kernel.

	* src/print.c (print_core): If `trace_flag', then invoke closure
	before outputting the items of the state (print_core is no longer
	a correct name them).
	(print_results): Invoke new_closure/free_closure if needed.

2001-12-05  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* src/LR0.c (new_itemsets): Use nshifts only, not shiftcount.
	* src/closure.c, src/closure.h (itemsetsize): Rename as...
	(nitemset): for consistency with the rest of the project.

2001-12-05  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* src/closure.c (print_closure): Improve.
	(closure): Use it for printing input and output.

2001-12-05  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* src/closure.c (FIRSTS, FDERIVES): Adjust to reality: they are
	indexed by nonterminals.

2001-12-05  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* src/warshall.c (TC, RTC): De-obsfucate (source reduced to 22% of
	what it was!).
	* src/warshall.h: Remove accidental duplication of the content.

2001-12-05  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* src/closure.c (set_fderives): De-obfuscate.

2001-12-05  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* src/closure.c (set_firsts): De-obfuscate.

2001-12-05  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* src/output.c (action_row): De-obfuscate
	using the good o' techniques: arrays not pointers, variable
	locality, BITISSET, RESETBIT etc.

2001-12-05  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	Pessimize the code to simplify it: from now on, all the states
	have a valid SHIFTS, which NSHIFTS is possibly 0.

	* src/LR0.c (shifts_new): Be global and move to..
	* src/state.c, src/state.h: here.
	* src/conflicts, src/lalr.c, src/output.c, src/print.c,

	* src/conflicts.c (flush_shift, resolve_sr_conflict): De-obfuscate
	using the good o' techniques: arrays not pointers, variable
	locality, BITISSET, RESETBIT etc.

2001-12-05  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* src/state.h (SHIFT_SYMBOL): New.

	arrays not pointers, variable locality, BITISSET.

2001-12-05  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* src/conflicts.c (print_reductions): Arrays, not pointers.

	Better variable locality.

2001-12-05  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* src/lalr.c (matrix_print): New.
	(transpose): Use it.
	Use arrays instead of pointers.

2001-12-05  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* src/lalr.c (maxrhs): Move to...
	* src/gram.c, src/gram.h (ritem_longest_rhs): here.
	* src/lalr.c (build_relations): Adjust.

2001-12-05  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* src/lalr.c (transpose): Free the memory allocated to the
	argument, as it is replaced by the results by the unique caller.
	(build_relations): Merely invoke transpose: it handles the memory
	deallocation.
	Improve variable locality.
	Avoid variables used as mere abbreviations.
	(compute_lookaheads): Use arrays instead of pointers.

2001-12-05  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* src/derives.c (print_derives): Display the ruleno.
	* src/lalr.c (initialize_F, transpose): Better variable locality
	to improve readability.
	Avoid variables used as mere abbreviations.

2001-12-05  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* src/lalr.c (traverse): Use arrays instead of pointers.

2001-12-05  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* src/nullable.c (set_nullable): Use a for loop to de-obfuscate
	the handling of squeue.
	`symbol >= 0' is wrong now, use `rule_table[ruleno].useful'.

2001-12-05  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	Because useless nonterminals are now kept alive (instead of being
	`destroyed'), we now sometimes examine them, and store information
	related to them.  Hence we need to know their number, and adjust
	memory allocations.

	* src/reduce.c, src/reduce.h (nuseless_nonterminals): No longer
	static.
	* src/LR0.c (allocate_itemsets): The memory allocated to
	`symbol_count' was used for two different purpose: once to count
	the number of occurrences of each symbol, and later reassigned to
	`shift_symbol', containing the symbol that can be shifted from a
	given state.
	Deobfuscate, i.e., allocate, use and free `symbol_count' here
	only, and...
	(new_itemsets): Allocate `shift_symbol' here.
	(allocate_itemsets): symbol_count includes useless nonterminals.
	Make room for them.
	(free_storage): Use `free', not `XFREE', for pointers that cannot
	be null.

2001-12-05  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* src/nullable.c (set_nullable): Deobfuscate the handling of
	ritem.
	`symbol >= 0' is wrong now, use `rule_table[ruleno].useful'.

2001-12-05  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* src/gram.c, src/gram.h (ritem_print): New.
	* src/gram.c (dummy): Remove, now there is actual code in gram.c.
	(This useless function was defined only to work around VMS linkers
	that can't handle compilation units with variables only).
	* src/reduce.c (dump_grammar): Use it to trace the construction of
	ritem.

2001-12-04  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/bison.simple (union yyalloc): Change member names
	to be the same as the stack names.
	(yyparse): yyptr is now union yyalloc *, not char *.
	(YYSTACK_RELOCATE): Likewise.  This avoids a GCC warning,
	and may generate better code on some machines.
	(yystpcpy): Use prototype if __STDC__ is defined, not just
	if __cplusplus is defined.

2001-11-30  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* configure.in (WARNING_CFLAGS): Add -Werror when possible.
	(CFLAGS): Do not include the WARNING_CFLAGS here, since GNU
	Gettext doesn't compile cleanly, and dies with -Werror.
	* src/Makefile.am, lib/Makefile.am, tests/atlocal.in (CFLAGS):
	Include WARNING_CFLAGS here.
	* lib/xstrdup.c: Include xalloc.h, so that xstrdup be declared
	before being defined.

2001-11-30  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/quotearg.h (quotearg_n, quotearg_n_style):
	First arg is int, not unsigned.
	* lib/quotearg.c (quotearg_n, quotearg_n_style): Likewise.
	(SIZE_MAX, UINT_MAX): New macros.
	(quotearg_n_options): Abort if N is negative.
	Avoid overflow check on hosts where size_t is 64 bits and int
	is 32 bits, as overflow is impossible there.
	Fix off-by-one typo that caused unnecessary reallocation.

2001-11-30  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Name space cleanup in generated parser.

	* doc/bison.texinfo (Bison Parser): Discuss system headers
	and their effect on the user name space.

	* src/bison.simple:
	(YYSTACK_ALLOC, YYSTACK_FREE, union yyalloc, YYSTACK_GAP_MAX,
	YYSTACK_BYTES, YYSTACK_RELOCATE): Do not define unless necessary,
	i.e. unless ! defined (yyoverflow) || defined (YYERROR_VERBOSE).

	(YYSIZE_T): New macro.  Use it instead of size_t, to avoid infringing
	on user names when possible.

	(YYSTACK_USE_ALLOCA): Do not define; just use any existing defn.
	Simplify test for whather <alloca.h> exists.

	(<stdlib.h>): Include if we will use malloc, and if standard C or C++.

	(<stdio.h>): Include if YYDEBUG.

	(yymemcpy): Renamed from __yy_memcpy.  Do not define unless
	! defined (yyoverflow) && ! defined (yymemcpy).

	(yymemcpy, yyparse): Rename local variables as needed so that
	they all begin with 'yy'.

	(yystrlen, yystpcpy): New functions.

	(YY_DECL_NON_LSP_VARIABLES): Renamed from _YY_DECL_VARIABLES.
	All uses changed.

	(yyparse): size_t -> YYSIZE_T.  Use yystrlen and yystpcpy
	instead of relying on string.h functions.  Use YYSTACK_ALLOC
	and YYSTACK_FREE instead of malloc and free.

2001-11-30  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* src/bison.simple (YYSTACK_FREE): Use `do {;} while (0)' as empty
	if body instead of `;' to pacify GCC's warnings.

2001-11-30  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	Instead of mapping the LHS of unused rules to -1, keep the LHS
	valid, but flag the rules as invalid.

	* src/gram.h (rule_t): `useful' is a new member.
	* src/print.c (print_grammar): Adjust.
	* src/derives.c (set_derives): Likewise.
	* src/reader.c (packgram, reduce_output): Likewise.

2001-11-30  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* src/reduce.c (nonterminals_reduce): Instead of throwing away
	useless nonterminals, move them at the end of the symbol arrays.
	(reduce_output): Adjust.
	* tests/reduce.at (Useless Nonterminals): Adjust.

2001-11-30  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* src/reduce.c: Various comment/formatting changes.
	(nonterminals_reduce): New, extracted from...
	(reduce_grammar_tables): here.
	(reduce_grammar): Call nonterminals_reduce.

2001-11-29  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/bison.simple (YYSTACK_REALLOC): Remove.
	(YYSTACK_ALLOC): Resurrect this macro, with its old meaning.
	(YYSTACK_FREE, YYSTACK_GAP_MAX, YYSTACK_BYTES, YYSTACK_RELOCATE):
	New macros.
	(union yyalloc): New type.
	(__yy_memcpy): Last arg is size_t, not unsigned int, to remove
	an arbitrary restriction on hosts where size_t is wider than int.

	(yyparse): Don't dump core if alloca or malloc fails; instead, report
	a parser stack overflow.  Allocate just one block of memory for all
	three stacks, instead of allocating three blocks; this typically is
	faster and reduces fragmentation.

	Do not limit the number of items in the stack to a value that fits
	in 'int', as this is an arbitrary limit on hosts with 64-bit
	size_t and 32-bit int.

2001-11-28  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* src/LR0.c (shifts_new): New.

	keep ruleno only.

2001-11-28  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* src/closure.c (closure): Instead of looping over word in array
	then bits in words, loop over bits in array.

2001-11-28  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* src/closure.c (closure): No longer optimize the special case
	where all the bits of `ruleset[r]' are set to 0, to make the code
	clearer.

2001-11-28  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* src/closure.c (closure): `r' and `c' are new variables, used to
	de-obfuscate accesses to RULESET and CORE.

2001-11-23  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* tests/calc.at, tests/output.at, tests/regression.at,

2000-10-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* bison.s1 (yyparse): Assign the default value

	translation, move some `\n' out of the translated strings.

2000-10-02  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	The location tracking mechanism is precious for parse error
	messages.  Nevertheless, it is enabled only when `@n' is used in
	the grammar, which is a different issue (you can use it in error
	message, but not in the grammar per se).  Therefore, there should
	be another means to enable it.

	* src/getargs.c (getargs): Support `--locations'.
	(usage): Report it.
	* src/getargs.h (locationsflag): Export it.
	* src/lex.c (percent_table): Support `%locations'.
	* src/reader.c (yylsp_needed): Remove this variable, now replaced
	with `locationsflag'.
	* doc/bison.texinfo: Document `--locations' and `%locations'.
	Sort the options.
	* tests/calc.m4: Test it.

	For regularity of the names, replace each
	(nolineflag, toknumflag, rawtokenumflag, noparserflag): with...
	(no_lineflag, token_tableflag, rawflag, no_parserflag): this.
	In addition replace each `flag' with `_flag'.

2000-10-02  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	Also test parse error messages, including with YYERROR_VERBOSE.

	* tests/calc.m4 (calc.y): Add support for `exp = exp' (non
	associative).
	Use it to check the computations.
	Use it to check `nonassoc' is honored.
	(AT_DATA_CALC_Y): Equip `calc.y' with YYERROR_VERBOSE when passed
	`--yyerror-verbose'.
	(_AT_CHECK_CALC): Adjust to this option.
	(_AT_CHECK_CALC_ERROR): New macro to check parse error messages.

2000-10-02  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	Test also `--verbose', `--defines' and `--name-prefix'.  Testing
	the latter demonstrates a flaw in the handling of non debugging
	parsers introduced by myself on 2000-03-16: `#define yydebug 0'
	was used in order to simplify:

	#if YYDEBUG
	if (yydebug)
	{
	...
	}
	#endif

	into

	if (yydebug)
	{
	...
	}

	unfortunately this leads to a CPP conflict when
	`--name-prefix=foo' is used since it produces `#define yydebug
	foodebug'.

	* src/bison.s1 [!YYDEBUG]: Do not define yydebug.
	(YYDPRINTF): New macro.
	Spread its use.
	* tests/calc.m4 (AT_CHECK_CALC): Do require a title, build it from
	the bison options.
	Also test `--verbose', `--defines' and `--name-prefix'.

2000-10-02  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	Improve the readability of the produced parsers.

	* src/bison.s1: Formatting changes.
	Improve the comment related to the `$' mark.
	(yydefault): Don't fall through to `yyresume': `goto' there.
	* src/output.c (output_parser): When the `$' is met, skip the end
	of its line.
	New variable, `number_of_dollar_signs', to check there's exactly
	one `$' in the parser skeleton.

2000-10-02  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* lib/xstrdup.c: New file, from the fileutils.
	* src/reader.c (parse_token_decl, get_type_name, parse_type_decl)
	(parse_assoc_decl, parse_thong_decl, get_type): Use `xstrdup'
	instead of strlen + xmalloc + strcpy.
	* src/symtab.c (copys): Remove, use xstrdup instead.

	* src/gram.h (associativity): New enum type which replaces the

	* src/reader.c: Formatting changes.
	(LTYPESTR): Don't define it, use it as a literal in
	`reader_output_yylsp'.
	* src/symtab.h (symbol_class): New enum type which replaces the
	former CPP macros `SUNKNOWN', `STOKEN and `SNTERM' with
	`sunknown', `stoken and `snterm'.

2000-10-02  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* src/getargs.c (fixed_outfiles): Rename as...
	(yaccflag): for consistency and accuracy.
	Adjust dependencies.

2000-10-02  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	Use the more standard files `xalloc.h' and `xmalloc.c' instead of
	Bison's `allocate.c' and `alloc.h'.  This patch was surprisingly
	difficult and introduced a lot of core dump.  It turns out that
	Bison used an implementation of `xmalloc' based on `calloc', and
	at various places it does depend upon the initialization to 0.  I
	have not tried to isolate the pertinent places, and all the former
	calls to Bison's `xmalloc' are now using `XCALLOC'.  Someday,
	someone should address this issue.

	* src/allocate.c, src/alloc.h, m4/bison-decl.m4: Remove.
	* lib/xmalloc.c, lib/xalloc.h, m4/malloc.m4, m4/realloc.m4: New

	Add support for `--statistics'.
	Adjust dependencies.

	* src/LR0.h: New file.
	Propagate its use.

	* src/output.c (token_actions): Introduce a temporary array,
	YYDEFACT, that makes it possible for this function to use
	output_short_table.

2000-10-02  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	`user_toknums' is output as a `short[]' in `output.c', while it is
	defined as a `int[]' in `reader.c'.  For consistency with the
	other output tables, `user_toknums' is now defined as a table of
	shorts.

	* src/reader.c (user_toknums): Be a short table instead of an int
	table.
	Adjust dependencies.

	Factor the short table outputs.

	* src/output.c (output_short_table): New function.
	* src/output.c (output_gram, output_stos, output_rule_data)
	(output_base, output_table, output_check):  Use it.

2000-10-02  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* src/reader.c (reader_output_yylsp):
	New function.
	(readgram): Use `#if 0' around code that accepted %command
	inside grammar rules:  The documentation doesn't allow it,
	and it will fail since the %command processors scan for the next %.
	(parse_token_decl):  Extended the %token
	declaration to allow a multi-character symbol as an alias.
	(parse_thong_decl): New function.
	(read_declarations): Added %thong declarations.
	(read_declarations): Handle NOOP to deal with allowing
	% declarations as another means to specify the flags.

	an invalid character.  Do not abort.
	(read_declarations, copy_guard, copy_action): Use
	printable_version to avoid unprintable characters in printed output.
	(parse_expect_decl): Error if argument to %expect exceeds 10 digits.
	(parse_token_decl, parse_assoc_decl, parse_type_decl, get_type):
	Allow the type of a non-terminal can be given
	more than once, as long as all specifications give the same type.

	(output_headers, output_trailers, output, output_gram)
	(output_rule_data): Implement noparserflag variable.

	always contain the token.  This includes growing the token
	buffer while reading an integer.
	(parse_percent_token): Replaced if-else statement with percent_table.
	(parse_percent_token): Added % declarations as another
	way to specify the flags -n, -l, and -r.  Also added hooks for
	-d, -k, -y, -v, -t, -p, -b, -o, but implementation requires
	major changes to files.c.
	(lex) Retain in the incoming stream a character following
	an incorrect '/'.
	(skip_white_space, lex):  Revised most error messages
	and changed fatal to warn to avoid aborting.
	(percent_table):  Added %thong declarations.

	* src/gram.h: Comment changes.

	* src/files.c (openfiles, open_extra_files, done):
	 Add faction flag
	and actfile file.  Handle noparserflag.  Both for -n switch.
