This is a test release of this package.  Using it more or less
implicitly signs you up to help us find whatever problems you report.

The documentation still needs more work.  Suggestions welcome.
Patches even more welcome.

Please send comments and problem reports about this test release to
bug-bison@gnu.org.  This program will get better only if you report
the problems you encounter.

Please, *do not package this*, *do not distribute it* widely, it is
not ready for full scale use.  Because it is not fully functional, if
you distribute this package, we will be buried under bug reports from
panicked users.  We don't have time to spend on this, and nor do the
users.
