This directory contains examples of Bison grammar files, sorted per
language.

Several of them come from the documentation, which should be installed
together with Bison.  The URLs are provided for convenience.

These examples come with a README and a Makefile.  Not only can they be used
to toy with Bison, they can also be starting points for your own grammars.

Please, be sure to read the C examples before looking at the other
languages, as these examples are simpler.
